## Steps
1. Type in your name.
2. Click Start(top right icon) to start the game and give starting data.
   - Starting data
     - GROW : 0 (increasing over the time)
     - WATER : 7 (decreasing over the time)
     - SUNLIGHT : 7 (decreasing over the time) 
     - FERTILIZER : 6 (decreasing over the time)
     - PESTICIDE : 0 (increasing over the time)
3. Find the instruction on the top left icon
4. Follow the plantâ€™s needs from the message box and keep it alive until the grow data increases from 0 to 10.
5. Click on restart button to play again no matter win or loss. 


## Rules
Best to keep data in the ranges below:
- 3 <= Water <= 8
- 5 <= Sunlight <= 10
- 3 <= Fertilizer <= 6
- 0 <= Pesticide <= 4

Click on buttons to increase/decrease data:
- Water +2
- Sunlight +4
- Fertilizer +3
- Pesticide -3

The plant will give an alert message if data is not enough or too much: 
- Water <= 3, Water meee!
- Water >= 9, Too much water!!!
- Sunlight < 5, Need a sunbath :)
- Fertilizer <= 2, Want some plant food!
- Fertilizer >= 7, Too much plant food!
- Pesticide >= 5, These bugs are killing me!

You will lost the game if following happens:
- Water = 0 or Water>=10 
- Sunlight = 0
- Fertilizer = 0 or Fertilizer >= 10
- Pesticide < -2 or Pesticide = 10
(Too much or not enough will kill the plant)

Keep it alive until Grow = 10, get blooms and win the game!
