## Steps
1. Click Start to start the game and give starting data
   - Starting data
     - GROW : 0 
     - WATER : 6 
     - SUNLIGHT : 5 
     - FERTILIZER : 5 
     - PESTICIDE : 1 
2. Following the plantâ€™s needs from the message and keep it alive until the grow data increases from 0 to 10.

## Rules
4 <= Water <= 8, decreasing over the time
- onclick Water +2
- Water <= 3, water me
- Water >= 9, too much water!
- Water <= 0 || Water>=10 => dead: lose the game 

3<= Fertilizer <= 6, decreasing over the time
- onclick Fertilizer +3
- Fertilizer <=2, feed me
- Fertilizer >= 7, too much fertilizer!
- Fertilizer <= 0 || Fertilizer >= 10 => dead: lose the game

0 <= Pesticide <= 4, increasing over the time
- onclick Pesticide -3
- Pesticide >=5, kill the bugs!
- Pesticide >= 10 => dead: lose the game (set if Pesticide < 0 => Pesticide = 0)

5 <= Sunlight <= 10, decreasing over the time
- onclick Sunlight +4
- Sunlight < 5, give me some sunshine!
- Sunlight <= 0 => dead: lose the game (set if Sunlight > 10 => Sunlight = 10)

If Grow = 10, win the game!
